# CognitiveServices
This repository holds several examples for code usages of Azure Cognitive Services in iOS and in Python.

The [video of the lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXaHVVyVV2Y) can be found online.

# Notes
- Client side: The iOS code is not completed but supplies a good starter. In general it bypasses the dependency of a server in the middle and uses an SDK that simply wraps the API calls.
- Server side: The Pyhton code supplies methods for the server (using various examples of Face API and Computer Vision API).
